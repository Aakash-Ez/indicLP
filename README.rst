*AI Development tools for Indic Languages*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Indic language processing library, is an effort to make it easy for
developers and researchers to build fascinating applications and models
in Indian Languages. The objective of this initiative is to develop an
all encomposing library, containing the necessary tools to process
language data while also methods to help in model development

Currently we support Hindi and Tamil, and are looking to support more
languages in the future. We are also looking to add more features in the
supported languages and improve the existing ones!

Tech
----

indicLP has been built on python as a package to help the developers
easily use it's functionalities without bothering about the code.
Furthermore to faciliate the intergation of deep learning models,
PyTorch layers have been added in torch.nn module of indicLP and
tokenization has been doing sentencepiece module of PyTorch.

Requirements: - Gensim >= 4.0.1 - torchtext >= 0.10.1 - torch >= 1.9.1 -
indic\_transliteration - snowballstemmer - zipfile
